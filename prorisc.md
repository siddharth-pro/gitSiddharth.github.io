## Architecture

* The CPU has a single 8-bit bus which is used for all data and address related operations, so it can support 256 bytes of memory to hold both instructions and data.
* The CPU is based on Von-Neumann architecture, so both data and address are stored in same memory.
* There are four 8-bit general purpose registers: R0, R1, R2 and R3.
* It has an instruction register (IR) to hold the instruction for the next operation. The Control signals are generated by a state machine according to the specific combination of bits in the instruction register. These control signals are applied to various registers, program counter and memory.
* It has a program counter (PC) which auto increments after each operation to point to the next instruction or data present in the memory.
* It has an address register (AR) to store immediate address of the memory location to be accessed during a particular operation.
* As of now the ALU performs limited operations like ADD, SUB, AND and NOT. The two operand registers OP1 and OP2 are used to give inputs to the ALU. 
* There is also a flag register to store information about zero and negative condition required for branch operations.
* The Multiplexer allows the output from registers, pc, alu and memory based on the select bits from the FSM.
* Two branch operations are possible: unconditional branch and branch if zero.

Note that I have used different wires to represent signals. 1-bit signals are control signals in and out of  the FSM which are applied to various registers and PC.
8-bit signals are data, instruction, address travelling on the bus. 4-bit opcode goes into the ALU to specify the operation. 3-bit signals are mux select inputs from the FSM.
