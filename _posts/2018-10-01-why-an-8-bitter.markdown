Coz 4-bit CPU is stupid, duh!. But [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) was still a champ though. I guess that depends, an 8-bit CPU can have less complicated hardware due to only so many operations possible. Small opcode means less functionality. Because of this the hardware can be small enough to fit into medium sized FPGAs like Spartan 3E and Cyclone IV, the ones I have. Also, since the processor is of RISC architecture, It is left to the user to add/remove any functionality they might want.
For me, this processor is a gate way to the world of opensource ISA like [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/). RISC-V is a complicated beast, to understand it one must understand the RISC architecture, and what's a better way to do it than implementing your own 8-bitter RISC CPU.
