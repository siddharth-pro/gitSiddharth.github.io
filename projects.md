### Serial communication between two FPGAs using UART
* UART receiver and transmitter is coded in verilog
* The reciever and transmitter functionality is verified using a testbench
* The design is synthesized and implemented on both spartan 3e and cyclone IV FPGA
* Tools used: Questasim, Xilinx ISE and Quartus II

### Design of an I2C to read data from LM75
* Implemented  in  readable VHDL code
* Clean module structure
* Leverages FuseSoC as build system
* Testbenches can be run with Xilinx ISE, Xilinx Vivado and GHDL
