title: Projects

### UART
* UART receiver and transmitter is coded in verilog
* The reciever and transmitter functionality is verified using a SystemVerilog testbench
* The design is synthesized and implemented on Cyclone IV FPGA
* Tools used: Altera Quartus II and Questasim

### Design of an IÂ²C to read data from LM75A
* Implemented in verilog
* Address and data cycles are as per the datasheet of LM75A
* Design is tested on Spartan 3E FPGA                                     
* Temperature data is obtained in hexadecimal
* Tool used: Xilinx ISE

### 8-bit RISC CPU
* The processor is coded in verilog
* The design is verified by writing the instructions to memory through backdoor access and letting the processor operate on those instructions
* Operations such as reading from memory to register, writing to memory, addition and subtraction are verified 
* Tool used: Questasim
