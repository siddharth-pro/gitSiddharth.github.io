introduction: |
 #### Serial communication between two FPGAs using UART

  - UART receiver and transmitter is coded in verilog
  - The reciever and transmitter functionality is verified using a testbench
  - The design is synthesized and implemented on both spartan 3e and cyclone IV FPGA
  - Tools used: Questasim, Xilinx ISE and Quartus II
