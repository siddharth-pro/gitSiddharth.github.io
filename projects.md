### Serial communication between two FPGAs using UART
* UART receiver and transmitter is coded in verilog
* The reciever and transmitter functionality is verified using a testbench
* The design is synthesized and implemented on both spartan 3e and cyclone IV FPGA
* Tools used: Questasim, Xilinx ISE and Quartus II

### Design of an I2C to read data from LM75A
* Implemented  in  readable verilog code
* Address and data cycles are as per the datasheet of LM75A
* Temperature data is obtained in hexadecimal
* Design is verified on cyclone IV FPGA board

### 8-bit RISC CPU
* The processor is coded in verilog.
* The design is verified by writing the instructions to memory through backdoor and letting the processor operate on those instructions.
* Operations such as reading from memory to register, writing to memory and addition are verified.
